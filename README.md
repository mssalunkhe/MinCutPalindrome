# MinCutPalindrome
Given a string, the program cuts it into minimum number of substrings which are palindromes.


Example 1:

Input: s = "aaab"
Output: 1
Explanation: The palindrome partitioning ["aaa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a"
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: s = "cd"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2000
